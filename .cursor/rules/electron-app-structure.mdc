# Electron App Structure Guide

This is an Electron application built with React, Webpack, and Electron Builder.

## Main Components

*   **Main Process Entry:** [electron/main.js](mdc:src/electron/main.js) - Handles the main Electron application lifecycle, window creation, and backend logic.
*   **Renderer Process Entry (React):** [src/index.js](mdc:src/index.js) - The entry point for the React frontend application.
*   **Main React Component:** [src/App.js](mdc:src/App.js) - The root component for the UI.
*   **Renderer HTML:** An `index.html` file is likely generated by Webpack (using `HtmlWebpackPlugin`) during the build process, typically located in the `build/` directory. This file loads the bundled JavaScript from `src/index.js`.

## Configuration

*   **Development Environment:** [.env](mdc:.env) - Environment variables for development.
*   **Production Environment:** [.env.production](mdc:.env.production) - Environment variables for production builds.
*   **Build & Packaging:** The `electron-builder` configuration is located within [package.json](mdc:package.json) under the `"build"` key.
*   **Webpack Configuration:** A Webpack configuration file (likely `webpack.config.js` or similar) manages the bundling of the renderer process code.

## Key Directories

*   **`src/`**: Contains the source code for the React renderer process.
*   **`src/electron/`**: Contains the source code for the Electron main process.
*   **`build/`**: (Likely) The output directory for the Webpack build, containing the bundled renderer code and `index.html`.
*   **`dist/`**: The output directory for the final packaged Electron application created by `electron-builder`.
*   **`assets/`**: Contains application assets like icons and entitlements files.
*   **`scripts/`**: Contains utility scripts used for building, signing, testing, etc.
